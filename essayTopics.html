					<li data-theme="d">Though McCandless' sets out on his journey in search of getting in touch with nature and freeing himself from the strains of society with no bad intentions, he is in a way very selfish in his quest.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He pushes everyone he knows and loves aside in this quest and completely cuts himself of from them.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">His goals are noble as he believes he is cleansing himself from a suppressive society, however they are also unfair to others.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He never seems to take into account how it will effect those close to him by completely uprooting himself without even a simple explanation.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Instead his family has to learn of his death by police and by people like John Krakauer who documented his journey through accounts with people he met.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">McCandless may have entered his journey a noble and courageous man, yet his goal of ultimate freedom not only hurt those closest to him, but was a great cause in his unfortunate death, as he had know one that could help him when he was in danger.</li>

				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">In what ways does McCandless parental issues, and difficulty with forgiveness drive his journey?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Growing up McCandless was always less interested with the material world than the average child and teenager, and as he matured he developed an even greater need to separate himself materialistic lifestyle.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Though this could have been done in a much easier way than completely uprooting himself and travelling the country without even a goodbye, he was driven by his parents attitudes to do so.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He never was very interested in law school, or expensive clothes or cars, however his parents seemed to push him in that direction and attempt to control him.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">McCandless was also upset with what he learned about his fathers past and previous relationships to the point where he felt as if he could not forgive him.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Because he was unable to forgive his parents, his father particularly, he chose to punish them in a way.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">When he set out on his new path in life, he left no trace as to where he was going and never spoke to his parents again.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">His journey, though not entirely, was done in attempt to punish his parents.</li>
